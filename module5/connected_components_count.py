connected components count

Write a function, connected_components_count, that takes in the adjacency list of an undirected graph. The function should return the number of connected components within the graph.
test_00:

connected_components_count({
  0: [8, 1, 5],
  1: [0],
  5: [0, 8],
  8: [0, 5],
  2: [3, 4],
  3: [2, 4],
  4: [3, 2]
}) # -> 2

test_01:

connected_components_count({
  1: [2],
  2: [1,8],
  6: [7],
  9: [8],
  7: [6, 8],
  8: [9, 7, 2]
}) # -> 1

test_02:

connected_components_count({
  3: [],
  4: [6],
  6: [4, 5, 7, 8],
  8: [6],
  7: [6],
  5: [6],
  1: [2],
  2: [1]
