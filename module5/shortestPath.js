/*
shortest path

Write a function, shortestPath, that takes in an array of edges for an undirected graph and two nodes (nodeA, nodeB). The function should return the length of the shortest path between A and B. Consider the length as the number of edges in the path, not the number of nodes. If there is no path between A and B, then return -1.
test_00:

const edges = [
  ['w', 'x'],
  ['x', 'y'],
  ['z', 'y'],
  ['z', 'v'],
  ['w', 'v']
];

shortestPath(edges, 'w', 'z'); // -> 2

test_01:

const edges = [
  ['w', 'x'],
  ['x', 'y'],
  ['z', 'y'],
  ['z', 'v'],
  ['w', 'v']
];

shortestPath(edges, 'y', 'x'); // -> 1

test_02:

const edges = [
  ['a', 'c'],
  ['a', 'b'],
  ['c', 'b'],
  ['c', 'd'],
  ['b', 'd'],
  ['e', 'd'],
  ['g', 'f']
];

shortestPath(edges, 'a', 'e'); // -> 3

/*
APPROACH
- create adjacency list from the edges given
- DFS vs. BFS -> we want to use BFS because it is better for "shortest path"
- on our queue, we want to initialize our starting node AND the starting distance
  - for example, it will look like (node, distance)
- we also want a visited Set because we have an undirected graph
